{"name":"DCCells","tagline":"Modeling dormancy in cancer cells","body":"<p>This project aims to model the interactions of dormant cancer cells with the bone environment. The aim is to develop a agent-based multicellular model of the bone environment utilizing the framework [FLAME](http://www.flame.ac.uk/). Later-on a more detailed implementation of specific signaling networks will be integrated running ODE-based models of them in COPASI and connecting those to the cell agents.\r\n<p>\r\nThe following figures illustrate the basic model and process layout\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
